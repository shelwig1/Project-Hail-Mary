Voice recognition - 

musical notes strung together
id musical notes, look them up in a table, show words on screen as we are hearing the notes
listens and prompts when a new word comes up

So what do we actually need to do here - 

-listen and identify musical notes
	-receive audio input

-look up combinations of musical notes in a table
	-if existing, display associated meaning
	-if does not exist, ask for meaning - can leave without meaning if we'd like


how the fuck does SQL work



Start
-listen to audio



-print out musical notes as we play them

-put musical strings into a database with a meaning attached to them

-actively translate music back into english as we play audio

Listen to audio and display the notes that are playing
	-can we do this in real time?

-Have the microphone listening
-ability to interpret audio as strings of frequencies
-ability to interpret frequencies as musical notes
